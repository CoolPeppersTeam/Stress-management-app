## GitHub Pages Deployment

The Flutter web version of the Stress Management App is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages on every push to the main branch.

### Live Demo
Visit the live application: [Stress Management App](https://slickip.github.io/Stress-management-app/)

### How it works
1. **Automatic Deployment**: When you push changes to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions automatically:
   - Sets up Flutter environment
   - Builds the web version of the app
   - Deploys it to GitHub Pages

2. **Deployment Configuration**: The deployment is configured in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

3. **Base URL**: The app is configured to work with the GitHub Pages base URL: https://slickip.github.io/Stress-management-app/

### Manual Deployment
If you need to deploy manually:

```bash
cd frontend
flutter build web --release --base-href /Stress-management-app/
```

## Core features
- [X] Creation and Viewing of Stress Sessions
- Users can create entries documenting stressful experiences, including description, stress level, and date.

///// (for screens/gifs)

- [X] Relaxation Recommendations
- The app provides relaxation suggestions, such as breathing exercises or mindfulness practices.
These may be displayed as a feed on the main screen.

///// (for screens/gifs)

- [X] Stress History and Statistics
- Users can access historical data and visualize trends, such as average stress levels over time and improvements.

///// (for screens/gifs)

## Technical stack
### Backend:

- [X] Go (Golang):
- High-performance language powering all backend APIs and business logic.

- [x] GORM:
- ORM library for database migrations and data access.

### Frontend:

- [X] Flutter:
- Cross-platform framework for building a responsive and smooth mobile and web user interface.

- [X] Authentication:
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

- [X] Real-Time Communication:
- WebSockets: enables live updates and notifications to clients.

- [X] Real-Time Updates

- WebSocket channels to broadcast updates (e.g., new recommendations or session changes)

- [X] History and Statistics

- Aggregation and retrieval of user stress history and analytics

### Frontend screens
- [X] Registration & Login

This diagram shows internal components and how they interact:
- [X] Frontend Modules:
- Authentication Module: Registration and login forms
- Stress Sessions UI: Creating and viewing stress entries
- Statistics & History UI: Visualizing past stress levels
- Recommendations Feed: Displaying relaxation suggestions
- WebSocket Client: Receiving live updates

- [X] Backend Components:
- Auth Controller: Handles registration and login
- JWT Middleware: Validates tokens for secured endpoints
- Stress Sessions Controller: CRUD operations for stress entries
- Statistics Service: Computes aggregates over stress data
- Recommendation Engine: Generates relaxation recommendations
- WebSocket Server: Pushes notifications to clients
- GORM ORM: Data access layer to the database

### Deployment diagram
![diagram](./docs/architecture/deployment_diagram.png)
This diagram shows the runtime deployment:

- [X] The User Device runs the Flutter app (web or mobile).
- [X] The API Server hosts:
- The REST API
- The WebSocket server
- [X] The PostgreSQL Database stores all persistent data.
- [X] The API Server communicates securely with clients and the database.

### Context diagram
![diagram](./docs/architecture/context_diagram.png)

This diagram shows the high-level context of the system:

- User interacts with the application through a Flutter-based mobile or web client.
- The Flutter Frontend communicates with the Go API Server over secure HTTPS for REST API calls and WebSocket connections for real-time updates.
- The Go API Server uses a relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing user accounts, stress sessions, and statistics.
